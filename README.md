# Project: Assisting in Setting Up Network Infrastructure in a Small Office in Nigeria

## Client
Jzek Enterprise, Uyo, Nigeria

## Project Duration
- **Start Date**: May 1, 2024
- **Completion Date**: June 7, 2024

## Objective
The objective of this project was to assist in designing and implementing a secure, reliable, and efficient network infrastructure for a small office with 20 employees in Nigeria.

## Scope
- Assist in the setup of network infrastructure including cabling, switches, routers, and wireless access points.
- Help in the configuration of network devices.
- Support the implementation of network security measures.
- Assist in setting up a local file server and backup solution.
- Ensure network connectivity for all office devices.

## Required Equipment
- Router (Cisco RV340)
- Switches (Cisco SG350-28)
- Wireless Access Points (Ubiquiti UniFi AP AC Pro)
- Ethernet Cables (Cat6)
- Patch Panels and Wall Jacks
- Network Rack
- File Server (Synology NAS)
- Backup Solution (external hard drives or cloud backup service)
- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
- Network Monitoring Software (SolarWinds)

## Steps to Setup the Network

### 1. Planning
- **Site Survey**: I conducted a site survey to determine the best locations for network equipment, wireless access points, and cabling routes.
- **Network Design**: I supported the creation of a network design that included a layout of the office, network topology, and IP addressing scheme.

### 2. Cabling
- **Cable Installation**: I assisted in running Cat6 Ethernet cables from a central location (network closet) to each workstation, wireless access point, and network device.
- **Termination**: I helped terminate cables at both ends with RJ45 connectors or patch panels and wall jacks as needed.
- **Testing**: I tested all cable runs for connectivity and performance using a cable tester.

### 3. Hardware Setup
- **Router Installation**: I installed and configured the router to manage network traffic and provide internet access.
- **Switch Setup**: I assisted in installing switches in the network rack and connected them to the router. I also connected workstations and other devices to the switches.
- **Wireless Access Points**: I installed wireless access points at optimal locations to ensure full coverage of the office. I helped configure SSIDs, security settings, and VLANs.
- **File Server**: I assisted in setting up the file server, configuring shared folders, and implementing access permissions. I ensured backup solutions were in place.

### 4. Configuration
- **Router Configuration**: I assisted in configuring the router for WAN and LAN settings, DHCP, firewall rules, and VPN access.
- **Switch Configuration**: I helped configure VLANs, QoS, and trunking on the switches to optimize network traffic.
- **Wireless Configuration**: I assisted in configuring wireless settings, including SSID broadcast, security (WPA3), and guest network access.

### 5. Security Implementation
- **Firewall**: I helped configure the firewall on the router to block unauthorized access and protect against external threats.
- **Network Segmentation**: I assisted in using VLANs to segment the network into different zones (e.g., admin, guest, employee) to enhance security.
- **Access Control**: I supported the implementation of access control policies to restrict who could access certain parts of the network.

### 6. Testing and Optimization
- **Connectivity Tests**: I tested all network connections to ensure devices could communicate with each other and access the internet.
- **Performance Testing**: I helped use network monitoring tools to check for any bottlenecks or performance issues.
- **Wireless Coverage Test**: I assisted in performing a wireless coverage test to ensure there were no dead zones in the office.

### 7. Documentation
- **Network Diagram**: I helped create a detailed network diagram showing all devices and their connections.
- **Configuration Documentation**: I documented the configuration settings for the router, switches, and wireless access points.
- **User Guide**: I supported the provision of a user guide for employees on how to connect to the network and access shared resources.

### 8. Training
- **IT Staff Training**: I assisted in training the IT staff on network management and troubleshooting.
- **Employee Training**: I helped educate employees on network usage policies, security best practices, and how to connect to the network.

## Best Practices
- **Regular Updates**: I helped keep firmware and software up-to-date on all network devices.
- **Regular Backups**: I assisted in implementing a regular backup schedule for critical data.
- **Network Monitoring**: I supported continuous monitoring of the network for performance and security issues.
- **Security Audits**: I assisted in conducting periodic security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
